<p>
Provides utility classes that implement common patterns in CSP and Actor-based
applications. The package includes patterns based on common actor functions 
such as message filtering, message logging, statistics and so forth. These are
provided as simple reusable classes and patterns that can be tailored and 
extended for additional purposes.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of the utils package is to provide common building blocks to allow
the programmer to reuse simple actors where possible for common tasks and also
to provide these as the foundation to build new patterns, either reusing the
provided actors as they are or to extend them into new function. 
</p>

<h2>What the <code>util</code> Package Contains</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Patterns:
    <ul>
      <li>{@link com.googlecode.acpj.patterns.RequestWithCallbackPattern} -- A 
          common pattern where one actor makes a request for some service to another
          actor and has to provide in the request a callback port for the result to
          be sent to.</li>
      <li>{@link com.googlecode.acpj.patterns.ChannelOperation} -- An interface 
          that represents a simple, but powerful function that can filter messages
          between two actors, transform the messages or simply monitor them.</li>
      <li>{@link com.googlecode.acpj.patterns.ChannelFilter} -- An Actor that
          uses a ChannelOperation as a filter and filters the messages between 
          two actors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
