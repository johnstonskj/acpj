#summary Describes the contents of the util package containing helpers and patterns.

= Introduction =

The `com.googlecode.acpj.patterns` package contains a set of helper classes that provide the implementation of common patterns such as the request-response, message filter and join-pool. These patterns are general enough to be used as-is but simple enough that they can be replaced if necessary by more app-specific versions if you need them. 

= Provided Patterns =

The following sections describe the patterns and their implementations as they exist currently.
